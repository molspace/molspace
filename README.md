# 👋 Hi, I'm Nurlybek Temirbay  
Machine Learning Engineer | NLP & Generative AI | Drug Discovery | MLOps

![Visitors](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=molspace&style=flat-square&color=blue)

I'm a machine learning engineer with 8+ years of experience building AI systems across healthcare and drug discovery. My work blends NLP, generative models, LLMs, and MLOps to build production-grade AI systems. I’ve published in peer-reviewed journals, deployed AI tools at scale, and worked with cross-functional teams in fast-paced startups and global R&D orgs.

## 📌 Featured Projects

- 💊 **Chem42 Molecule Generator**  
  Built generative model pipeline (GNN + validity filtering) for real-world synthesizable molecules.

- 🎯 **LLM-powered Retrosynthesis**  
  Cleaned and generated 10M+ reaction entries using OpenAI + Hugging Face. Boosted top-5 retrosynthesis accuracy by 7%.

- 🔎 **Semantic Healthcare Knowledge Graph**  
  Used PyTorch, Spark, and biomedical ontologies to create 2M+ node graph. Enabled concept-level document retrieval.
